===================
Profiler middleware
===================

This package provides middleware for profiling of the application.  It's based
on `paste.debug.profile <http://pythonpaste.org/modules/debug.profile.html>`_,
but uses cProfile instead of hotshot.

If you use PasteScript, enabling the profiler is as simple as adding ::

  [filter-app:profile]
  use = egg:keas.profile#profiler
  next = main

to your paster configuration file and passing ``--app-name=profile`` to
``paster``.  When you access your web application, every page will have the
profiler output appended to the end of the document body.
